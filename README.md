# PingPongApp

Started for an assessment.
The react side is unfinished. Would need to re-evaluate the overall design for the front end, in order to finish.
The api works well as is, but it might need more functionality to implement all of the app requirements.

Also, I had to exclude the node_modules/ in the react app, because it was too big.
running "npm install" within the pingpong-app directory is enough to get the modules.
